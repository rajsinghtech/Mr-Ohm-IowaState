If you just want the latest bit files then the easiest option is to grab
them from the outputs of the CI tools which are linked from
https://github.com/orbcode/orbtrace/actions

To build on Linux you will need yosys (https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys),
nextpnr (https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) and, optionally,
a GCC RISC-V toolchain (https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain).

You can also get everything as part of oss-cad-suite
(https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build), or look at the CI
workflow at https://github.com/orbcode/orbtrace/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml

Dependancies such as Linux, Amaranth and Migen are automatically downloaded
as part of the build process, so you don't need to get those manuallly...and
indeed, your versions won't be used even if you do.

ORBTrace has been sucessfully built on OSX and Linux (Specifically Ubuntu). If
you have any problems building on your platform please drop us a note and
we can expand the instructions.
